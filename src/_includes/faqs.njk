                <p>If you're someone who has a clear vision and perhaps a bit of design know-how, submitting a Figma design file could
                    be the way to go. This method is perfect for those who have their website design polished and ready to go. By providing
                    a final design file in Figma format, you're ensuring that we can maintain a streamlined process from design to
                    development. It's all about efficiency and precision, making sure that the website we build together perfectly matches
                    your expectations.</p>

                    <p>For those who already have a Webflow site or have fallen in love with a specific template, this approach allows us to
                        build upon what you already admire. It's about taking the essence of your current site or chosen template and infusing
                        it with fresh innovation. This method ensures that your new site retains the familiarity and appeal of your existing
                        online presence while elevating it to new heights.</p>

                            functionality of your chosen example, ensuring that every detail aligns perfectly with your expectations. It's an ideal

                            <p>For those who are looking for a more guided approach, collaborating directly with me combines your inspiration with
                                my design expertise. By sharing 5-10 website designs that resonate with you, we can start to understand your aesthetic
                                preferences and functional needs. I'll then craft a mockup of the home page, setting the foundational tone for your
                                entire site. This collaborative method ensures that the final design truly reflects your brand's identity and meets your
                                specific needs.</p>
